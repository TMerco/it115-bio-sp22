Hello, I’m Tyrell Mercolino, an emerging professional studying Application Development at Seattle Central College. I strive to always be learning and getting better at my coding skills. Coding is a passion of mine that I recently fell in love with. I work very well in teams and with that, I have a great understanding of when it’s time to step forward as a leader and when it’s time to allow space for others to express ideas/ concerns. I already have the skills of a great developer and I'm persistent to get better each day.
